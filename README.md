# About this project

This is a cybersecurity project of 42 school, following in the footsteps of the [snow-crash](https://github.com/Sleleu/snow_crash) project, aims to familiarize oneself with binary exploitation.

Several notions are covered in this project, including:

- Basics of reverse engineering
- Stack / heap buffer overflow
- Buffer overflow via environment variables
- GOT overwrite
- Format string attack vulnerabilities
- Use of gdb
- Understanding assembly (a bit ðŸ™ƒ)

  To start, ssh with level0/level0 on 10.0.2.15:4242
```

This project is presented in the form of a virtual machine with 14 levels available. Each level contains a binary in the user's /home directory. The objective is to exploit this binary in order to progress to the next level.

Each level should have a folder containing:

- The flag that allows access to the user of the next level
- Source code obtained from the decompiled executable, providing a better understanding of the binary's structure to be exploited
- A walkthrough describing the steps to successfully exploit it


Many challenges, after identifying how to exploit the vulnerability through the debugger, assembly instructions, and decompiled code, will look like this:

```
(python -c "print('A' * 76 + '\x44\x84\x04\x08')"; cat) | ./binary <== poof ðŸ’£
Good... Wait what? <== ðŸ’€
whoami
levelup
cat /home/user/levelup/.pass
{flag} <== ðŸš©
```
